  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! I'm Pavani Karnati, a Computer Science graduate student at the University of New Haven with a strong passion for software development. I specialize in Python and Java, and I enjoy building clean, efficient, and scalable applications. My skill set spans full-stack technologies including Spring Boot, REST APIs, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue.js, and Node.js.

As I approach graduation, Iâ€™m excited to apply my technical knowledge and problem-solving mindset to real-world software challenges. I'm a quick learner who thrives in collaborative, fast-paced environments. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and crafting user-centric solutions that combine performance, simplicity, and strong database design.

I take pride in adapting to new technologies quickly and enjoy turning complex problems into elegant, practical solutions that create real value.
